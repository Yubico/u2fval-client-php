== Example
A passwordless sample server allowing a user to register and authenticate U2F
devices with a U2FVAL server.

=== Setup
To include the required files 

  require_once(dirname(__FILE__)."/../src/Client.php");
  require_once(dirname(__FILE__)."/../src/Exceptions.php");
  if(!function_exists("curl_init")) die("You require CURL for PHP");

Or install via Composer using

  $ composer.phar install

You will also need to configure the endpoint and authentication to use for the
U2FVAL server. Edit config.php and fill in the required values.
